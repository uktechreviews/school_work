Interest vs power

As leaders we lead and impement change and want people to come with us on your journey.
Low interest and low power --> monitor (keep them going)
Low interest and high power --> keep satisfied and keep on track
High interest but low power --> keep them informed and maximise their interest
High interest and high power --> Key players and manage closely
