# Implementing change

Mendelow's Matrix
Interest vs power

As leaders we lead and impement change and want people to come with us on your journey.
Low interest and low power --> monitor (keep them going)
Low interest and high power --> keep satisfied and keep on track
High interest but low power --> keep them informed and maximise their interest
High interest and high power --> Key players and manage closely

> [!NOTE]
I / U matrix

How do we interact with our staff
<p>I+ U+ I respect myself and I respect you <br>
I- U+ You doubt yoursel and resepect yourself less than the person you are linemanaging <br>
I+ U- I respect myself more than the person I am linemanaging 
</p>


> <p>You will know the staff and nothing is every fixed.  Relationships can always improve.  Need to be aware of the dynamics. We can easily fall into I+U- </p>

## Us as leaders

Three important questions

[ ] Who do we work for?

[ ] Do you have 'skin in the game'

[ ] Do you stay the course?
