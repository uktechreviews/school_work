# Implementing change

> [!NOTE]
Mendelow's Matrix

As leaders we lead and impement change and want people to come with us on your journey.

Low interest and low power --> monitor (keep them going)

Low interest and high power --> keep satisfied and keep on track

High interest but low power --> keep them informed and maximise their interest

High interest and high power --> Key players and manage closely

> [!NOTE]
I / U matrix

How do we interact with our staff
<p>I+ U+ I respect myself and I respect you <br>
I- U+ You doubt yoursel and resepect yourself less than the person you are linemanaging <br>
I+ U- I respect myself more than the person I am linemanaging 
</p>


> <p>You will know the staff and nothing is every fixed.  Relationships can always improve.  Need to be aware of the dynamics. We can easily fall into I+U- </p>

## Us as leaders

Three important questions

[ ] Who do we work for?

[ ] Do you have 'skin in the game'

[ ] Do you stay the course?

Do you have the time and systems in place to implement change

Quality assurance

Does everyone know what the focus is?
What does success look like?

> [!IMPORTANT]
If staff are not engaging with the new initiative, probe and tease out why?

Do we confirm what are we doing, what are we changing and when will see the development implemented?
